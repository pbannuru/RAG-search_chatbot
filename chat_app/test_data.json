        "reference": "### Spot Color Alias in HP Indigo Presses\\n\\n#### Overview\\nSpot color aliasing is a feature in HP Indigo presses that allows users to create and maintain custom tables of spot colors and their desired separation values. This is particularly useful for ensuring color consistency and accuracy in print jobs.\\n\\n#### Working with Spot Color Tables\\nSpot color tables allow users to define custom spot colors and their separation values. These tables can be managed through the web client and are selected in the job ticket for a particular print job. The following features are supported:\\n\\n1. **Creating a New Spot Color Table**:\\n   - To create a new spot color table, navigate to the System tab, expand Resources in the Navigation Panel, and click on Spot Color Tables.\\n   - Click on \\'New\\', type a name for the new spot color table, and then click \\'Save\\'.\\n\\n2. **Importing a Spot Color Table**:\\n   - To import a spot color table, click on \\'Import\\', browse to locate the .csv file to import, and then click \\'Open\\'.\\n   - Note: The imported .csv file must match the formatting requirements for spot color tables. The name of the table in the .csv file is used as the name of the imported spot color table.\\n\\n3. **Editing a Spot Color Table**:\\n   - To edit a spot color table, select a spot color table entry in the list, and then click \\'Edit\\'.\\n   - Make the necessary edits to the color table, and then click \\'Save\\'.\\n\\n4. **Duplicating a Spot Color Table**:\\n   - To duplicate a spot color table, select a spot color table entry in the list, and then click \\'Duplicate\\'.\\n   - Type a name for the new spot color table, and then click \\'Save\\'.\\n\\n5. **Exporting a Spot Color Table**:\\n   - To export a spot color table, select a spot color table entry in the list, and then click \\'Export\\'.\\n   - A CSV file containing the spot color table definition is immediately made available for download through the web client.\\n\\n#### Important Notes\\n- Each custom spot color table defines a set of required separations. The job can define additional separations not in the table, but a job fails if one or more of the separations in the table is not defined in the job.\\n- In the custom spot color interface, special recognized separation names are represented with the appropriate color dot. Other separation names are represented with a gray star.\\n- To avoid conflicting operations, do not simultaneously edit a spot color table in multiple browser sessions.\\n\\n#### References\\n- [HP Production Pro for Commercial - User Guide](https://www.printos.com/knowledge-zone/#/view/asset/393447), Page 81\\n- [HP Production Pro for Labels and Packaging - User Guide](https://www.printos.com/knowledge-zone/#/view/asset/393448), Page 98\\n\\n### Sources List\\n1.

        "reference": "To manage metalized substrates effectively, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n1. **Modes of Operation**:\\n   - **Special Mode for Non-Conductive Metallic Substrates**: This mode discharges the substrate to prevent print quality issues and high voltage short circuits. It decreases the printing speed by adding two additional nulls to each page.\\n   - **Regular Mode**: This mode runs at the regular speed without an additional discharge sequence. It is suitable for substrates that do not have exposed metalized edges.\\n\\n2. **Handling Non-Conductive Substrates**:\\n   - If the substrate is cut in a way that leaves metalized edges exposed, use the special mode to prevent electrostatic discharge.\\n   - If you hear a discharge noise or see print quality issues, switch to the special mode regardless of how the substrate was cut.\\n\\n3. **Switching Modes**:\\n   - To switch from special mode to regular mode:\\n     1. Select **Menu > Options > Print Preferences > Print Mode**.\\n     2. Clear the **Activate special mode for non-conductive metallic substrate** checkbox.\\n\\n4. **Electrostatic Shock Risks**:\\n   - Non-conductive metalized substrates have an inherent risk of electrostatic shock, especially when printing to the stacker.\\n   - The risk of electrostatic shock is minimal when printing to the proof tray of the press or the proof tray of the TRESU iCoat 30000.\\n   - Use a grounding brush to discharge the electrostatic charge before touching the metalized substrate.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, refer to the [Defining Metalized Substrates TN-2316](https://www.printos.com/knowledge-zone/#/view/asset/43175) document.\\n\\n### Sources:\\n1.

        "question": " Dynamic Prism",
        "reference": "The dynamic prism is a crucial component in HP Indigo presses, designed to improve registration by compensating for small and fast changes in press speed and angular position. Here are the detailed steps to test and troubleshoot the dynamic prism:\\n\\n### Testing the Dynamic Prism\\n1. **Diagnostics Check:**\\n   - Navigate to `Diagnostics > Writing Head > WH Elements` tab.\\n   - Observe the range of the Prism compensation in the Max and Min fields in the Position window.\\n   - If the range is greater than ±300, there is a serious mechanical problem or incorrect/unstable motor speed that needs to be corrected first.\\n\\n2. **Print Registration Job:**\\n   - Print a few sheets of the `SBN_Registration` job and observe the registration.\\n   - In the `Diagnostics > Writing Head > WH Elements` tab, force the dynamic prism position to 0.\\n   - Ensure the hand icon is enabled (white). Click on the hand icon with the right mouse button to enable it.\\n   - Print a few sheets of the `SBN_Registration` job again and observe the registration.\\n   - If the registration is worse, the dynamic prism is functioning properly. Release the force.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting the Dynamic Prism\\n1. **Check Controller Version:**\\n   - In the `Options > Systab Editor > whif960ConfigTopic`, check the `dynamicPrismType`.\\n   - It should be `HT_VER2`. If it is `HT_VER1`, try reinstalling the writing head from the floppy. If it remains `HT_VER1`, contact HP.\\n\\n2. **Check Connections:**\\n   - Shut down the system and switch off the mains power supply and UPS.\\n   - Remove the writing head cover.\\n   - Check all cables and connections to ensure the dynamic prism control board is properly seated. Remove and reinstall the board if required.\\n\\n3. **Replace Components:**\\n   - If necessary, replace the dynamic prism control board.\\n   - Replace the electronic plate if required.\\n\\n### Additional Steps\\n- **Toggle Dynamic Prism Position:**\\n  - Force the dynamic prism to 300 and print the `SBN_Registration` job.\\n  - During the run, the dynamic prism will revert to approximately 0.\\n  - Toggle between the 0 position and the 300 position during the run by placing the cursor in the 300 field and pressing `<Enter>` multiple times.\\n  - Observe the range of the dynamic prism compensation in the position window to ensure the toggle is working.\\n\\n- **Main Motor Control Troubleshooting:**\\n  - In the `Options > Systab Editor > mainMotorTopic`, change the `baldorFullSpeedRpm` saved value to the default value.\\n  - If there is an improvement in registration, there was a main motor speed problem.\\n  - Print about 400 separations in one run. If the problem reappears, it may be due to scaling.\\n  - In the `Options > Systab Editor > scalingParametersTopic`, change the `verticalScalingDirection` and `verticalUserScalingDirection` to `DIR_NONE`.\\n  - Reset the `baldorFullSpeedRpm` saved value to the default value.\\n\\n### References\\n- [HP Indigo Service Document Writing Head](https://www.printos.com/knowledge-zone/#/view/asset/24932) (Page 45-47)\\n- [Dynamic POS and Dynamic Mirror Technical Service](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_9480701_en-US-6) (Page 5)\\n- [HP Indigo Service Document Registration Troubleshooting](https://www.printos.com/knowledge-zone/#/view/asset/26621) (Page 13)\\n\\n### Sources List\\n1.

Here are some key points about BID:\\n\\n1. **Functionality**: The press uses BID to build ink inside the BID unit and transfer it to the image areas on the Photo Imaging Plate (PIP). Excess ink flows back into the BID and out to the ink tank. Each BID unit is responsible for generating a different color separation, although the units are identical ([source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_7606095_en-US-4), page 217).\\n\\n2. **Components**:\\n   - **BID Base**: The base part of the BID unit.\\n   - **Developer Roller**: Works in conjunction with the BID base to develop the ink.\\n\\n3. **Configurations**:\\n   - **Single-unit BID**: The BID unit, comprising the BID base and the developer roller, can only be replaced as a whole.\\n   - **BID-P**: The BID unit comprises two components—the BID base and the developer roller—which can be replaced separately ([source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_7606095_en-US-4), page 217).\\n\\n### Installing the BID Base and BID Handle\\n\\nTo install the BID base and BID handle, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Components Required**:\\n   - BID Base (C8Q07C) for BIDs 1–7.\\n   - BID Developer (C8Q01B) for BIDs 1–7.\\n   - BID Handle (CA445-51093) for BIDs 1–6.\\n\\n2. **Installation Steps**:\\n   - Insert the BID Base into the BID Drawer.\\n   - Insert the BID Developer into the BID Base and lock it in place with clamps.\\n   - Install the BID Handle onto the outer front side of the BID Base using a 5mm key to tighten 4 M6 screws.\\n   - Spray Imaging Oil onto BID Developer and BID Base tubes ([source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=ish_9862126-9713016-16), page 1).\\n\\n### BID Engage System Service\\n\\nThe BID engage system service involves several procedures:\\n\\n1. **Inspection**:\\n   - BID engage cable and sensor connection.\\n   - Front and rear BID engage motor connectors and cables.\\n\\n2. **Cleaning**:\\n   - BID sensors.\\n   - Front and rear BID sensors.\\n\\n3. **Replacement**:\\n   - BDU (BID Drive Unit).\\n   - BID sensors.\\n   - BID engage motor.\\n   - BID Motor (MOP) and its housing ([source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_9373161_en-US-6), page 3).\\n\\n### Sources List\\n\\n1. **Installing the BID Base and BID Handle**:\\n   - Document: Installing the BID Base and BID Handle\\n   - Author: UDP\\n   - Link: [source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=ish_9862126-9713016-16)\\n   - Page: 1\\n\\n2. **BID Engage System**:\\n   - Document: BID Engage System\\n   - Author: UDP\\n   - Link: [source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_9373161_en-US-6)\\n   - Page: 3\\n\\n3. **Binary Ink Developer (BID)**:\\n   - Document: the press User Guide\\n   - Author: UDP\\n   - Link: [source](https://kcs-dev.corp.hpicloud.net/api/v1/extras_kaas/render_url?documentID=pdf_7606095_en-US-4)\\n   - Page: 217"
